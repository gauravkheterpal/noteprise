Noteprise - Bringing the best of Evernote & Salesforce together!

Evernote is the most popular note app for mobile users all over the world. However, its usage has been limited to personal, productivity, entertainment or small business applications. We at Noteprise want to take the Evernote goodness to the enterprise world. 

The Motivation

We love Evernote. We've been using it for taking notes for as far as we can remember. Being force.com developers, we often encountered situations where we’ll need to copy and paste text (and even images) to Salesforce CRM. We eventually got tired of the manual copy-paste process and decided to build Noteprise.  

Why Salesforce & Evernote?

* Evernote - The #1 Note Taking App globally
* Salesforce - The #1 cloud-based CRM platform

Clone this repo using Eclipse with the Android SDK and then deploy the Noteprise app on a Android device or emulator. All libraries are included and there should no need for you to modify any resources to use the app. The minimum required API level for the Noteprise app is Android 2.3.
